# Radio contest manager
A tool to analyze radio contest files. Currently supports EDI file type.<br/>
To analyze the contest data prepare all EDI files inside a folder, then open the program and click on the "load files" button and select the folder.<br/>
The program will analyze the files and search for connections.<br/>
The connections can be of two types:
